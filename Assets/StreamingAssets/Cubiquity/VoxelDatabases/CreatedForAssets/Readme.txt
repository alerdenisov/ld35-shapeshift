When an empty VolumeData asset is created within Unity the corresponding voxel database is placed in this folder. This is to help seperate them from voxel databases which have been generated by other means (e.g. external tools). It means that when trying to purge old voxel databases we only need to look in this folder and can avoid deleting voxel databases which have come from elsewhere.
