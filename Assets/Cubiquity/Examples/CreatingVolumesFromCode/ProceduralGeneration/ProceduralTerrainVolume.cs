/**
 * This class serves as an example of how to generate a TerrainVolume from code. The exact operation
 * of the noise function(s) is not particularly important here as you will want to implement your own
 * approach for your game, but you should focus on understanding how data is written into the volume.
 * Please note, most of the 'magic numbers' in this code are simply found by trial and error as there
 * is a lot of experimentation required to generate procedural terrains. Feel free to change them and
 * see what happens!
