Welcome to Cubiquity for Unity3D!
=================================

The online version of the documentation can be found here: http://www.cubiquity.net/cubiquity-for-unity3d/1.2/docs/

This folder contains a PDF version of the documentation, because the HTML version contains JavaScript which confuses Unity. We recommend you refer to the online documentation above if possible.
