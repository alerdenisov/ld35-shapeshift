						// not too slowly, as both of these will result in a jagged appearance to the mesh.
						//
						// We probably want the transition to occur over a few voxels, whereas it currently occurs over 255 voxels
						// because it was derived from the distance. By scaling the density field we effectivly compress the rate
						// at which it changes at the surface. We also make the center much too high and the outside very low, but
