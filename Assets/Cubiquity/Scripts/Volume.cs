	 * Volumes are probably the single most fundamental concept of %Cubiquity. They essentially provide a 3D array of voxels which the user can
	 * modify at will, and they take care of synchronizing and maintaining a mesh representation of the voxels for rendering and collision detection.
	 *
	 * The Volume class itself is actually an abstract base class which cannot be instantiated by user code directly. Instead is serves as a base
	 * for the ColoredCubesVolume and TerrainVolume and encapsulates some of the common behaviour which such derived classes need. It is used in
	 * conjunction with the VolumeData, VolumeRenderer and VolumeCollider to form a structure as given below:
	 *
	 * \image html VolumeComposition.png
	 *
	 * Note how this is conceptually similar to the way that Unity's mesh classes are structured, where the MeshFilter works in conjunction with 
	 * the Mesh, MeshRenderer and MeshCollider classes.

        // The octree can then be attached to this ghost object rather than the real volume. This get's rid of the harmless error
        // message because the ghost is at the root of the scene, and so there is no parent object to complain when it is not
        // found on scene load. However, this solution has some known problems:
        //
        //     - The bounding box of the real volume is no longer correct, as it has no tree/mesh data of it's own. You can't
        //       manually set the bounding box, so we'd probably have to create a fake degenerate mesh and attach it to the
        //       volume. The coresponding MeshFilter/MeshRenderer then show up in the volume inspector, I believe even with the
        //       'HideInHierarchy' flag set (they are then greyed out).
        //
        //     - The 'Show Wireframe' feature doesn't work, as you can only see the wireframe of a selected object and you can't
        //       select the hidden ghost object.
        //
        //     - I also have concerns about how well selection/gizmos will work with a ghost object. For example, clicking the
        //       ghost in the scene view should select the ral object. But this isn't really tested yet.
        //
        // The second solution is to attach the octree to the real volume game object, and then attempt to delete it before
        // serialization is performed. Unity won't allow us to modify the object hierarchy in the OnDisable() method, so we have
        // to resort to using the slightly 'hacky' functions below. The only know drawback of this approach is that it means
        // the scene is flagged as 'unsaved' immediatly after saving it (probably because the octree is then rebuilt). But
