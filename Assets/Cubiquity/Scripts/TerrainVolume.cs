	/// Allows the creation of dynamic terrains featuring caves and overhangs.
	/**
	 * The TerrainVolume behaves as a logical extention to Unity's built in terrains, but using a true volumetric (3D) represnetation of the world
	 * instead of a 2D heightmap. This allows the construction of features such as caves and overhangs which are not normally possible in Unity. It
	 * is also far more flexible in terms of the modifications which can be performed at runtime, allowing (for example) a tunnel to be dug into a
	 * hillside. This kind of modification is not possible using Unity's built in terrains because it would result in a structure which cannot be 
	 * represented by the heightmap.
	 * 
	 * Aside from these enhancements, %Cubiquity's TerrainVolume provides similar functionality to the standard Unity terrain. Tools are provided to
	 * sculpt that shape of the terrain and also to paint on it with a number of materials. The TerrainVolume can also be modified from code by 
	 * getting the underlying TerrainVolumeData and manipulating it directly though the provided API. This allows you to write your own tools or
	 * actions as required by your specific gameplay mechanics.
	 * 
	 * \image html smooth-terrain.jpg
	 * 
	 * Each voxel of the TerrainVolume represent the material which exists at that location. More accuratly, a voxel can actually represent a *combination*
	 * of materials, such that it could be 50% rock, 40% soil, and 10% sand, for example. Please see the documentation on MaterialSet for a more
	 * comprehensive coverage of this.
	 * 
	 * The TerrainVolume class is used in conjunction with TerrainVolumeData, TerrainVolumeRenderer, and TerrainVolumeCollider. Each of these derives
	 * from a base class, and you should see the documentation and diagram accompanying the Volume class for an understanding of how they all fit
	 * together.
