	/// Base class representing the actual 3D grid of voxel values
	/**
	 * This class primarily serves as a light-weight wrapper around the \ref secVoxelDatabase "voxel databases" which are used by the %Cubiquity engine,
	 * allowing them to be treated as Unity3D assets. The voxel databases themselves are typically stored in the 'Streaming Assets' or 'Temporary Cache'
	 * folder (depending on the usage scenario), with the actual path being specified by the 'fullPathToVoxelDatabase' property. The VolumeData and it's
	 * subclasses then forward requests such as finding the dimensions of the voxel data or getting/setting the values of the individual voxels.
	 * 
	 * An instance of VolumeData can be created from an existing voxel database, or it can create an empty voxel database on demand. The class also
	 * abstracts the properties and functionality which are common to all types of volume data regardless of the type of the underlying voxel. Note that
	 * users should not interact with the VolumeData directly but should instead work with one of the derived classes.
	 * 
	 * When you modify the contents of a VolumeData (though GetVoxel() and SetVoxel()) the changes are immediatly visible, but they are not actually
	 * written to the underlying voxel database. Instead they are stored in a temporary location and can be commited or discared as you wish. For example,
	 * in play mode it may make sense to load an original volume, have it undergo changes in-game, and then discard these changes (see DiscardChanges()) 
	 * on shutdown so that it reverts to it's original state for the next game. On the other hand, if you are writing an editor then you will probably want 
	 * to commit the changes which have been made (see CommitChanges()). Alternatively you could use this functionality to implement an 'undo' system.
